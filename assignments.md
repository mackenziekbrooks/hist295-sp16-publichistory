# Assignment #2: Museums in the Digital Age 

From ["Getting to the Stuff: Digital Cultural Heritage Collections, Absence, and Memory"](http://www.lotfortynine.org/2012/11/getting-to-the-stuff-digital-cultural-heritage-collections-absence-and-memory/) by Sheila A. Brennan.
> "There is great potential for history museums (including historical societies and historic properties) in the US to contribute and help make connections by applying digital tools and methodologies to their collections. Except there is a problem: history museums in the US, generally do not share much online, and when they do share little of it is discoverable, open, or extractableâ€“unlike libraries and some archival collections that have made great strides in digitization, many museum catalogs are not shared or digitized. 

This week, we're spending time look at how museums 


Brennan's post may be dated, but her comments are a useful introduction to this assignment. How have museum practices changed in the last few years? What role does social media play in that change? To complicate matters more, how must museums adapt to a world where much of our cultural heritage product is not physical? What and how do museums collect when websites, apps, emails, and snaps make up the bulk of our communciation with each other? 

This three-part assignment introduces students to the spectrum of digital public history tools, methods, and environments.  Part 1 consists of an annotated bibliography on the topic of your choice. Part 2 will be evidence and description of hands-on engagement with your topic. Part 3 will be the presentation of your topic to the rest of the class. 

Topics:
* **Wikipedia** - Wikipedia is a pervasive source for consuming information. It simplifies fact-checking, but it also has the potential to simplify understanding historical events. See James Bridle's [Iraq War Wikipedia Historiography project](http://booktwo.org/notebook/wikipedia-historiography/). How does the public interact with Wikipedia? How do professors and students use Wikipedia? How can cultural heritage institutions use it to their advantage? What are some of the problems with Wikipedia? 
* **Web Archiving** - The average life of a webpage is 100 days. What does this mean for our cultural and intellectual output? Can we preserve the web for future study? See ["Can the Internet be archived?"](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/cobweb) 
* **Snapchat in museums** - How can museums and other cultural heritage institutions use social media, especially ephemeral platforms like Snapchat, to engage with the public? Is Snapchat just another trend? Does social media engagement increase engagement in other venues?
* **Crowdsourcing platforms** - Libraries and museums have turned to the public for assistance in making their holdings more discoverable on the internet. Contributors are asked to transcribe handwritten diary entries or identify people in photographs. Crowdsourcing projects not only benefit the institution, but provide paths of engagement for an interested public. 

**Part 1: Annotated Bibliography**
* 6-8 entries
* 1-2 paragraph annotations
* Properly formatted Chicago style citations
* Due to the nature of these topics, there may not be a substantial body of professional literature on your topic. It is acceptable to use blog posts or other internet sources, but you must critically address the source in your annotation.

**Part 2: Activity**

This section of the assignment will look different for each topic. Submit a 1-2 page summary of your engagement with the platform. Include URLs when applicable. How is this public history? Who holds the authority? 
* Edit Wikipedia. 
* Select an ephemeral topic and gather URLs that you wish to preserve. 
* Select a cultural heritage institution and storyboard a Snapchat story. 
* Choose a crowdsourcing project and contribute to it.

**Part 3: Presentation**
In a 20 minute presentation, summarize your topic and its issues for the class. Lead the class in a brief exercise so that your classmates can experience the platform themselves.
