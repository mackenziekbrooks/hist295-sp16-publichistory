# Assignment #2: Tech trends in Cultural Heritage Institutions 

From ["Getting to the Stuff: Digital Cultural Heritage Collections, Absence, and Memory"](http://www.lotfortynine.org/2012/11/getting-to-the-stuff-digital-cultural-heritage-collections-absence-and-memory/) by Sheila A. Brennan.
> "There is great potential for history museums (including historical societies and historic properties) in the US to contribute and help make connections by applying digital tools and methodologies to their collections. Except there is a problem: history museums in the US, generally do not share much online, and when they do share little of it is discoverable, open, or extractable unlike libraries and some archival collections that have made great strides in digitization, many museum catalogs are not shared or digitized. 

Brennan's post may be dated, but her comments set the stage for this assignment and our closer look at museums this week. How has technology changed museum practices, even since this 2012 article? What role does social media play in that change? To complicate matters more, how must museums adapt to a world where much of our cultural heritage product is not physical? What and how do museums collect when websites, apps, emails, and snaps make up the bulk of our communciation with each other? 

As an employee of a cultural heritage institution (especially as a recent college graduate), you will be expected to keep up with recent trends in technology. This assignment is designed to introduce you the tools and methods of digital public history. You will conduct research on a tool/methodology, experiment and engage with that tool/methodology, then present your findings back to the class. While your primary audience is your professors and classmates, you may also want to select a specific cultural heritage institution and its respective audience(s) that could benefit from this tool/methodology.

Topics:
* **Wikipedia** - Wikipedia is a pervasive source of information. It simplifies fact-checking, but it also has the potential to simplify understanding historical events. See James Bridle's [Iraq War Wikipedia Historiography project](http://booktwo.org/notebook/wikipedia-historiography/). How does the public interact with Wikipedia? How do professors and students use Wikipedia? How can cultural heritage institutions use it to their advantage? What are some of the problems with Wikipedia? 
* **Web Archiving** - The average life of a webpage is 100 days. What does this mean for our cultural and intellectual output? Can we preserve the web for future study? See ["Can the Internet be archived?"](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/cobweb) 
* **Snapchat in museums** - How can museums and other cultural heritage institutions use social media, especially ephemeral platforms like Snapchat, to engage with the public? Is Snapchat just another trend? Does social media engagement increase engagement in other venues?
* **Crowdsourcing platforms** - Libraries and museums have turned to the public for assistance in making their holdings more discoverable on the internet. Contributors are asked to transcribe handwritten diary entries or identify people in photographs. Crowdsourcing projects not only benefit the institution, but provide paths of engagement for an interested public. 

**Part 1: Annotated Bibliography**
* 6-8 entries
* 1-2 paragraph annotations
* Properly formatted Chicago style citations

Due to the nature of these topics, there may not be a substantial body of professional literature on your topic. It is acceptable to use blog posts or other internet sources, but you must critically address the source in your annotation. We will hold a research workshop on Monday of Week 2 to aid in the research process.

List of sources due Friday 5/6 in class. 

**Part 2: Activity and Documentation**

Activities by topic:
* Edit Wikipedia. The extent and type of your edit is up to you.
* Select an ephemeral topic and gather URLs that you wish to preserve. 
* Select a cultural heritage institution and storyboard a Snapchat story. 
* Choose a crowdsourcing project and contribute to it.

Activity Documentation:
In 1-2 pages, address the following questions:
* Provide evidence of your activity. This could be via URL, screenshot, or descriptive narrative. 
* Beyond your research for the annotated bibliography, how did you go about learning more about your topic? Particularly, how do you learn to *use* your piece of technology? Were there tutorials or documentation that you found useful?
* What type of cultural heritage institution could this tool/methodology benefit?  Why did you select that type of institution? What are some potential challenges? 
* How does your tool/methodology engage with the public? Does it promote access and use of the collections or is there another goal? What types of audiences could it reach? 
* Does your tool/methodology control, disperse, or share authority? (Foster) What progress does it make toward documenting an increasingly electronic culture?

Consult with your professors on Friday 5/6 if you have questions about this assignment.

**Part 3: Presentation**
 
Give a 20 minute presentation to the class on your topic. Your presentation should be more than just a summary of your research. Take what you've learned so far about engaging the public and put it to use in your presentation. Lead the class in an activity that allows them to experience your tool/methodology first-hand. You could assign the class a role as a particular audience, for instance, a pitch to other museum professionals or a workshop for elementary school teachers. 

# Assignment #3: Curatescape Project 



Using the Curatescape platform and Special Collections resources, create a walking tour of Lexington. This will be a collaborative project, though each student will be responsible for contributing their own site "stories." 

Technically, Curatescape is a walking tour theme for the popular digital collections and exhibit platform [Omeka](http://www.omeka.org). It is also an interpretive framework, one that privileges the "stories" that can be told by layering text and multimedia. 

After reviewing the material available to you, it will be up to your group to determine the type of narrative you want to tell. Curatescape provides for individual site "stories" as well as thematic "tours" made up of multiple stories. 

Requirements:
* Each student must research and write 4-5 stories. 
* Stories can and should contain a mix of archival and contemporary media. 
* Stories should be thoroughly researched and proper attribution/citation given.
